                        Industry requirements are changing rapidly. The type and variety of work being outsourced from global companies to India, has changed over the last decade. Today's business models are different than the decade-old models. Global customers prefer to work with engineering companies & individuals who are serious about engineering along with being capable of offering solutions to the problems rather than entrusting their work to a few services based companies only.
